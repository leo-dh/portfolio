<Title>What is it?</Title>

    This is a simple web application for book reviews that was developed for my database course
    project. This is a stripped down version of the original project, as the initial contains
    aspects like AWS automation and big data analytics that I was not heavily involved in. The
    dataset used for the reviews has not been cleaned or processed, so do expect placeholder values
    to be used.

  <Text>
    The web application uses Django as the backend server to serve a RESTful API while the frontend
    is composed of a React application written in Typescript using the Gatsby framework. The
    frontend also uses the Ant Design library for most of its components. Unfortunately, the web
    application was not designed to be responsive due to a lack of time, so it needs to be viewed
    using a desktop viewport.
